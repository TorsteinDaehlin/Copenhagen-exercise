# Copenhagen exercise study
This repository contains code compute segment and joint kinematics and kinetics from motion capture data. Specifically, this code is adapted to perform
inverse kinematics and dynamics on lower extremity motion capture data collected from participants performing the Copenhagen Adductor Exercise. However,
would be relatively easy to extend for other tasks, marker sets, or outcomes of interest.

### Required software
To run this code, you need [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and its [Signal Processing Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/signal.html). The code herein, was originally developed in MATLAB 2019b and heavily refactored for use in the research using MATLAB 2024a. The refactored code has only been tested on MATLAB 2024a and newer and backcompatability cannot be guaranteed. 

### How to set up and use the code
1. Fork this repository to your github account.
2. Clone the fork to your machine. 

Once the code is cloned to your machine, you are ready to use the code to analyze your motion capture data.
